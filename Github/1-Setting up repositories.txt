---------QUICK SETUP GUIDE:
**	1) downloads:
I had a 64 bit eclipse (prob not too relevant yet) so I D/L'd 64 bit tortoiseSVN

install that whatever way (I think i should have installed extra icons to look nicer). and then it should be ready to go/ always running, at least in windows explorer.
**	2) To "export" files/ download from a repository:
rightclick "tortoiseSVN -> export"
**	3) to link to a repository (for easy sync/ commit):
rightclick "SVN checkout"
From here, new options will appear:
(a) "SVN Update" to download the latest committed version from repository. (NB always do this first incase you overwrite later versions!)
(b) "SVN commit" to save all your latest changes as the most up-to-date revision of the code base.

**	4) Creating a repository:
can create an online one quite easily via github. 
-go to homepage, click repositories tab, & click "new". choose a name, & description if needed. MUST be public with github free.
-(initialising a readme is kinda pointless since its a weird file (readme.md).)
-then to link to this repository, use the http address. (e.g. https://github.com/user_name/repository_name)

**  -OR for a local repository, go to desired local [EMPTY] folder, and click "TortoiseSVN -> create repository here"
note that this folder must be currently EMPTY, and not write-protected!

------------------------------------------------


to set up this folder, heres my steps:
-create "notes" repository. (include readme.md, cos i think it complained when i didnt last time)
-note that (i think) this repository will then automatically include subfolders for "trunk" and "branches"
-go to desired base folder on local drive
-rightclick and select "svn checkout" to pull down files from server into this folder (-> will pull down readme)
-careful to delete any automatic folders it tries to create, e.g. (repository_name) folder locally, 
- and also to be safe in the repository url i added a "trunk" subfolder to ensure my notes appeared on github webpage easily.

-Then, to add my notes, i just rightclicked "add", deselected-then-reselected folder and any notes i wanted to commit.
	(or i could have just done whole folder, but i didnt wanna upload everything)
- and then rightclicked "commit"
