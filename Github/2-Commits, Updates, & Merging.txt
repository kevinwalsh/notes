"SVN Checkout" = essentially get/download latest working copy of project, to work on it. select a repository, and it will be copied to your selected/ current directory.

**"import" = actually uploads a file TO the repository!!! 
	(I kinda assumed it would download FROM....)

"export" = counterintuitive, but grabs all files FROM a repository for use.
	-> NB usually does to a subfolder, but if necessary, it will write to wherever AND WILL OVERWRITE any duplicate files!!
