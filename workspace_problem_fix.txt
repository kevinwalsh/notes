apparently the workspace folder contains a bunch of metadata stuff.
NEVER copy it over into other settings!
Also, if you wanna share projects, advice is to store it outside workspace folder!
can link to eclipse, using: file->import->general->existing projects into workspace
OR just by dragging and dropping too.
