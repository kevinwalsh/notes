
very brief, abstract, 18-9-14:

browsing wikis, etc
-(namely http://www.societyofrobots.com/microcontroller_uart.shtml)

-many diff types of serial comms, e.g. usb, rs232, ttl
	-> think TTL is just Transistor-Transistor Logic

-UART is an important acronym (came up alot at hackathon). basically just a general term for serial connection device
-UART = Universal Asynchronous Receiver/ Transmitter


-**N.B. rs232 != usb, 	(i.e. theyre DIFFERENT!) i think its just 12v vcc vs 5v, as attenuation was more of prob back before usb.
-**N.B. sounds like TTL is prob what most microcontrollers will use. technically not same as usb (but close?)

-however once we know what we wanna convert from and to, its a pretty simple process (relatively).

-**N.B. suggested converter/adapter IC's: 
	can make my own [TTL->USB?] using a FT232RL or CP2102


also suggests TTL-bluetooth wireless adaptor, but doesnt give IC suggestions.


-**N.B. Tx and Rx pins:		Tx on host goes to Rx on slave, etc! (we dont connect like to like).
		and obv ground is common.
		also says that connecting wrong will fry device, and if were worried it suggests adding a 2kOhm resistor on line.



-synchronous Data Transmission: clock timing very important! if clocks out of sync then datastream may corrupt!
	fine if clocks well sync'd. 
	and if not, can run both devices off a single clock source, i.e. via a separate CLK signal wire.

-ASYNCHRONOUS data transmission also avoids sync problem (send data whenever!) but must agree certain protocols in advance,
	e.g. start & stop bits, packet size/length, check bits. also clocks (and/or? baud rate) must relatively agree, around 10%


-**N.B. very handy "loop-back test"! for troubleshooting comms probs between hardware & software.
	connect (i assume short?) the Tx & Rx pins on one device, then run code, e.g. send message "ABC",
	and have code await a returning "ABC" message, and turn on an led or something when received.
	do again on the PC side at the USB port. it also suggests/ mentions using HyperTerminal for this.
	and lastly do it again on the TTL to USB adapters
