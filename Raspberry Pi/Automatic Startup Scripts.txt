*****SUMMARY, TO SET UP X11VNC AUTOSTART
----------------------------------
(summary of last entry, confirmed)

install x11vnc
go to /home/pi/.config
create "autostart" folder
create file called "x11vnc.desktop"
run command "chown -R pi /home/pi/.config/autostart"		where pi is the user in question
then in x11vnc.desktop, add the following:
	[Desktop Entry]
	Encoding=UTF-8
	Type=Application
	Name=X11VNC
	Comment=
	Exec=x11vnc -forever -usepw -display :0
	StartupNotify=false
	Terminal=false
	Hidden=false

to store/ set password, type "x11vnc -storepasswd"   and then enter desired password


------------------------

Can run bash commands by putting them in an .sh file, and then in terminal window, inputting "./myfile.sh"



BUT to make them run automatically on startup, the [file location] CORRECTION file itself needs to be added to /etc/init.d script! (i think)



-Think we also have to enable some checkbit thing in some file too..... 
		--->edit: did not need!

-** AND N.B. make sure .sh file is EXECUTABLE!!!! easiest is to do "chmod 777 /path/to/myfile.sh"








---------------------------------
SUMMARY according to http://askubuntu.com/questions/334040/script-at-etc-init-d-does-not-run-at-start-up
1 - make file
2 - move it to /etc/init.d folder
3 - make it executable (chmod)
4 - add it to the update scripts list using "sudo update-rc.d myfile.sh defaults"


and from site http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12973777/how-to-run-a-shell-script-at-startup    its implied:
that we may also have to create a link to rc.d using "ln -s /etc/init.d/myfile.sh /etc/rc.d"
-and that we need to add "#!/bin/sh" to the start of [that] file


**N.B. to get rid of "missing LSB tags" warning when adding to rc.d, basically include a header as follows:
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          scriptname
# Required-Start:    $remote_fs $syslog
# Required-Stop:     $remote_fs $syslog
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Short-Description: Start daemon at boot time
# Description:       Enable service provided by daemon.
### END INIT INFO

(may also need the #!/bin/sh     bit at the start). most above stuff "CAN" be blank, but best to leave default, i.e. numbers alone

--------------------

(QUICK TESTS, DEBUG, SETUP, ETC)

got it working fine for stuff like DATE or ECHo, to a file. (even in same file).
-but x11vnc simply wont run, ive tried a bunch of variations, leaving out &, sudo, >>logfile.log, etc.... nothing has worked



--------------------------
**IGNORE ABOVE - got auto start working, using the following:
- instructions taken from http://cymplecy.wordpress.com/2014/02/09/auto-install-x11vnc/		and the accompanying link

-(double check, but prob only need to do the following)
go to /home/pi/.config
create "autostart" folder
create file called "x11vnc.desktop"
run command "chown -R pi /home/pi/.config/autostart"		where pi is the user in question
then in x11vnc.desktop, add the following:
	[Desktop Entry]
	Encoding=UTF-8
	Type=Application
	Name=X11VNC
	Comment=
	Exec=x11vnc -forever -usepw -display :0
	StartupNotify=false
	Terminal=false
	Hidden=false
