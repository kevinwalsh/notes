- it actually mirrors the pi, i.e. it lets you take over the current session, 
	(as opposed to programs like [xxxx] which open up a new "desktop", like accessing as a diff user or something)

-couple other advantages, cant recall right now



-----
to install, "sudo apt-get install x11vnc"


-to run once, putty in and type "x11vnc"
	but this will terminate once we login once and exit, or if we close the putty window
**N.B. when logging in, may need to specify port number when entering IP address!!
		---> (it seems if we add sudo prefix, then we dont have to specify port number as mentioned above!)


- to be able to log in and back out infinitely* (i.e. while putty is left open), can use "x11vnc -forever"
	

- to run permanently until the machine is restarted, include **SUDO** (apparently needed) and an ampersand (to run in background).
		 i.e. " sudo x11vnc -forever &"
